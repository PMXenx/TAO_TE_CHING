# üêõ Troubleshooting

## **Problem: App won't install on Android**

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're using Chrome browser (not Firefox, Samsung Internet, etc.)
2. Make sure the app is loaded from HTTPS (GitHub Pages is HTTPS)
3. Try clearing Chrome cache: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Chrome ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clear Cache
4. Try the manual method: Menu (‚ãÆ) ‚Üí "Add to Home screen"

## **Problem: Images won't load**

**Solution:**
1. Check internet connection (images load from Unsplash)
2. Wait a few seconds for images to load
3. If offline, images from first visit will be cached

## **Problem: GitHub Pages shows 404**

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you pushed to the correct branch
2. Check Settings ‚Üí Pages shows "Your site is live"
3. Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling Pages
4. Make sure URL includes `/index.html` at the end

## **Problem: PWA features don't work**

**Solution:**
1. PWA only works over HTTPS (not `file://`)
2. Make sure manifest.json is in the same folder
3. Make sure service-worker.js is in the same folder
4. Check browser console for errors (F12)

## **Problem: Offline mode doesn't work**

**Solution:**
1. Must load the app online at least once
2. Service worker needs time to cache (wait 30 seconds)
3. Close and reopen the app
4. Try visiting 2-3 passages to cache them
