## Troubleshooting

### App won't install on Android

- Make sure you're using **Chrome browser** (not Firefox, Samsung Internet, etc.)
- Try the manual method: Menu (⋮) → "Add to Home screen"
- Clear Chrome cache: Settings → Apps → Chrome → Storage → Clear Cache

### Images won't load

- Check your internet connection (images load from Unsplash)
- Wait a few seconds for images to load
- Once cached, images work offline

### Old UI appears instead of new UI

- This was a service worker caching issue that has been **FIXED**
- If you see the old UI with emojis instead of photos:
  1. Clear browser cache completely
  2. Uninstall the PWA from home screen
  3. Visit the URL again in Chrome
  4. Install fresh from the browser

### Offline mode doesn't work

- Load the app online at least once first
- Visit 2-3 passages to allow caching
- Close and reopen the app
- Wait 30 seconds for service worker to cache assets

### Key Files

## Development

### Service Worker Fix (Important!)

The app had a critical bug where it would revert to an old UI version after installation. This was caused by the service worker hardcoding the wrong HTML file.

**The fix:**
- Updated `service-worker.js` to cache `index.html` instead of `spiritual_tao_app.html`
- Changed navigation handler to serve the actual requested file
- Bumped cache version to `v2` to force refresh

See [SERVICE-WORKER-FIX-GUIDE.md](SERVICE-WORKER-FIX-GUIDE.md) for detailed technical analysis.

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a browser
3. For PWA features, serve over HTTPS:
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000

   # Then access via ngrok or similar for HTTPS
   ```

### Updating the App

To update the deployed version:

1. Make your changes to the files
2. Commit and push to the `main` branch
3. GitHub Pages will auto-update in 1-2 minutes
