## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. UI Restoration - 100% Complete

- ✅ Restored UI to match the target screenshot exactly
- ✅ Gold header with sparkle emojis (✨)
- ✅ Purple passage titles using Cinzel font
- ✅ Beautiful photography with text overlays
- ✅ Teal "Daily Application" boxes
- ✅ Two-row navigation layout
- ✅ Proper button positioning and colors

### 2. Critical Bug Fix - Service Worker

**Problem:** App was reverting to old UI after installation

**Root Cause:** Service worker was hardcoded to cache and serve `spiritual_tao_app.html` instead of `index.html`

**Solution:**
- Updated `service-worker.js` lines 8 and 85-91
- Changed STATIC_ASSETS to cache `index.html`
- Modified navigation handler to serve actual requested file
- Bumped cache version to `v2` to force refresh

**Result:** Bug completely resolved - app now stays on correct UI
