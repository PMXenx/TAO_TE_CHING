## 🤔 Possible Confusion

**I think you might be confusing:**

### ✨ Sparkle Emojis (decorative) - THESE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE!
- In the subtitle: "✨ Let the Way guide your journey ✨"
- These are just decoration in the text
- NOT the same as the old emoji icons
- Your target screenshot has these too!

### 🌫️ Emoji Icons (old UI) - THESE SHOULD NOT BE THERE
- Large emoji symbols WHERE PHOTOS SHOULD BE
- Like: 🌫️ ☯️ 🕊️ 🌸 instead of actual images
- These appeared in spiritual_tao_app.html
- You do NOT have these in your screenshot!

## 🎯 Visual Reference

**What you DON'T want (old UI):**

## ❓ Question for You

When you said "it has the old UI with emojis," were you referring to:

**A)** The small sparkle emojis (✨) in the subtitle?
- These are supposed to be there!
- They match your target screenshot!
- They're decorative, not the "old emoji icons"

**B)** Large emoji icons WHERE PHOTOS SHOULD BE?
- Like seeing 🌫️ instead of the poppy photo?
- I don't see these in your screenshot
- Your screenshot shows real photos!

**C)** Something else entirely?

Please clarify so I can help! But based on your screenshot, **the app is working perfectly!** ✨
